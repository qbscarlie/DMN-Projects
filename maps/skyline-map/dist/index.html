        <h4>The rise of downtown Dallas skyscrapers over the decades</h4>
        <p>During the 1980s, Dallas’ skyline grew by nine major skyscrapers – the most ever. Since then, the race to build tall buildings has slowed to a crawl. Only one downtown tower taller than 40 floors has been built since the 1980s. Another one with 45 floors is on the way. Here are the downtown towers with 40 stories or more built since the 1960s.</p><p>
