# DMN-Projects

These are all the projects I made while interning with the Dallas Morning News during the summer of 2017. Here are links to the stories in which each project was included:

## maps
These are all maps I made using Mapbox and a script that connects Google Sheets to an S3 bucket so that they can be updated by the author whenever needed.

[lakes](https://www.guidelive.com/fun-places-and-events/2016/05/24/summer-chillout-lowdown-dfw-lakes): A map showing lakes around the DFW area and what they offer.

[spooky-map](https://www.guidelive.com/fun-places-and-events/2017/06/03/10-haunted-places-dallas-fort-worth-texas-ghosts): A map showing haunted locations around the DFW area and giving a brief overview of them.

[waterparks-map](https://www.guidelive.com/take-the-kids/2016/05/24/find-best-water-parks-free-splash-pads-dallas-fort-worth): A map showing waterparks around the DFW area, their contact info, and what they offer.

## divine-nine-embed
This was a component of a feature story about the divine nine Greek chapters in Dallas and their history. I made this embeddable to show basic facts about all nine chapters, along with a picture and quote from each one.

I used Handlebars along with the script to connect a Google sheet to an S3 bucket so that the reporter could update information as she acquired it.

## people-slider-template
This was a template I made so that it would be easy for others on the Interactives team to make embeddable sliders for stories to introduce people/places/etc. in a story. This uses the same mechanics as the divine nine embeddable to retrieve data from a Google sheet.
